### Samples of published works

* [Who is Trevion Williams?](https://purdue.rivals.com/news/purdue-basketball-who-is-trevion-williams-)

Trevion Williams breakout freshman year caught most people by surprise. His journey to Purdue, however, is a winding tale of gun violence, weight loss, family and love that explains why no one will be overlooking the Boilermaker big man going forward.

* [Gabby Graves-Wake: From Taekwondo champion to Para-sled hockey gold medalist](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/07/04/marine-veteran-excels-adaptive-sports-after-motorcycle-accident/703387002/)

Gabby Graves-Wake taught herself how to walk again after a motorcycle accident left her paralyzed while she was in the Marine Corps. Her journey before and after the life-threatening injury has shown the Phoenix community the power of adaptive sports.

* [The Caleb Swanigan Story: From Big to Biggie](https://www.purdueexponent.org/sports/article_0a0a36a1-48d5-575c-be8a-82342c1e19c8.html#comments)

I wrote this story about former Purdue forward Caleb Swanigan in the midst of his All-American campaign. His battle with obesity and homelessness made his journey to the NBA a truly incredible story. I’m especially proud of this story because, in the days following its print publication, national media outlets like ESPN and Sports Illustrated followed up with Swanigan and wrote their own version of this story.

* [Life without Basketball: How Jay Simpson clawed his way back from depression](https://www.purdueexponent.org/sports/article_0a7f5205-77b7-5c78-8f31-0a6ba83d9328.html#comments)

I wrote this story after I learned about former Boilermaker Jay Simpson’s downward spiral since he left the Purdue basketball team due to a heart condition. His journey back from depression is inspiring and the people who know Jay best were candid about his struggles to me.

* [One chant. A perfect game](https://www.purdueexponent.org/sports/article_9cf29f84-a6e5-5e08-950d-e4709079448f.html)

This column was written after Purdue upset No. 2 Ohio State this football season. I tried to explain what it sounds like when a football team pulls of its biggest upset in three decades. I also emphasized the importance of one Purdue student, Tyler Trent, during this win because his battle with bone cancer has inspired a whole university.


* [The Purdue team the crowd doesn’t see](https://www.purdueexponent.org/sports/mens/basketball/article_bbbf7ac5-9f7f-5b57-9c02-62965eebe868.html)

This is a story I wrote just before Purdue basketball defeated Indiana to win the Big Ten title. I spent a few weeks learning about how on the night before big college basketball games, both team’s student managers face off against each other in historic, empty arenas around the country.

* [Savage Storm win Division 1 title at 16th annual NABI tournament](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/high-school/2018/07/14/savage-storm-capture-boys-division-1-nabi-tournament-title/786012002/)

This story was written on deadline during my summer at the Arizona Republic. I showed up to this tournament without any contacts or any particular leads. A few hours later, I was able to uncover the story behind the magical run of a team that had never practiced together.

* [How Suns' Elie Okobo went from shooting guard to point guard](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2018/07/07/how-phoenix-suns-elie-okobo-went-shooting-guard-point-guard/766022002/)

I caught up with Phoenix Suns rookie Elie Okobo to document some of the struggles that international players coming to the NBA face. I wrote this story to help introduce a relatively unknown player to the Phoenix fan base and wrote about some of the obstacles he overcame as a young professional in France.
